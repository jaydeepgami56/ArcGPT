Examples:
1.This on-premises web service architecture ensures scalability, high availability, and real-time monitoring. Nginx ("ingress") handles traffic, forwarding requests to a gRPC-based service cluster ("grpc1", "grpc2", "grpc3"). Redis ("session") stores user sessions with a replica for failover, while PostgreSQL ("users") maintains HA with a replica. Prometheus ("metric") collects performance data, visualized via Grafana ("monitoring"). Fluentd ("logging") aggregates logs, streaming them to Kafka ("stream"), then processed by Apache Spark ("analytics"). This setup enables efficient traffic management, durability, and real-time insights, making it ideal for enterprise applications and large-scale web services
2. AWS ALB ("ingress") manages traffic, routing it to an ECS Fargate cluster ("service1", "service2", "service3"). ElastiCache Redis ("session") stores user sessions with a replica for failover, while Amazon RDS PostgreSQL ("users") ensures HA with a replica. Amazon CloudWatch ("metric") collects performance data, visualized via Amazon QuickSight ("monitoring"). Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose ("logging") streams logs to Amazon MSK ("stream"), processed by AWS Glue ("analytics").
